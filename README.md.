# Titanic Prediction Project

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
- Imputation of missing values using a machine learning approach

The notebook also demonstrates score improvements by replacing mean/mode imputation with a predictive model.

## Files
- `Titanic_New.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: Titanic dataset used for training and testing.
- `titanic_model2.pkl`: Trained Random Forest model with 83% accuracy.

## How to Use
Clone the repository, open the notebook, and follow the steps to run the project.
